## News

- 2021-06-01: I became a member of the [Phi Tau Phi](http://www.phitauphi.org.tw/) scholastic honor society.

## Short Biography

I am a postdoctoral researcher affiliated with [Software and Computational Systems Lab](https://www.sosy-lab.org/) at LMU Munich, Germany.
I obtained a Ph.D. degree in Electronics Engineering from National Taiwan University in 2021.
My research directions are the validation and optimization of computational systems, with a focus on applying formal methods.

I enjoy doing research and collaborating with people from different countries.
During my doctoral study, I was also
a research intern at [IBM T. J. Watson Research Center](https://www.research.ibm.com/labs/watson/) (2016.07-2016.10),
an internship student at [National Institute of Informatics](https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/) (2018.09-2019.02),
and a visiting student at [LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/) (2019.09-2020.08).

If you want to know more about me, please take a look at my [CV](../files/Nian-Ze.Lee.CV.pdf).

- [`ssat-benchmarks`](https://github.com/NTU-ALComLab/ssat-benchmarks): a collection of stochastic Boolean satisfiability formulas for benchmarking (**Contributions Welcome!**)
- [`threABC`](https://github.com/nianzelee/threABC): collapse operation and efficient verification of threshold logic in a synthesis/verification tool [`ABC`](https://github.com/berkeley-abc/abc)

I participate in the following projects:

- [`CPAchecker`](https://gitlab.com/sosy-lab/software/cpachecker): a configurable software-verification platform
  - I contribute to adopting McMillan's [interpolation-based model-checking algorithm](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-45069-6_1) to software.
- [`BenchExec`](https://github.com/sosy-lab/benchexec): a reliable and precise benchmarking framework
  - I contribute to incorporating SAT solver [Kissat](https://github.com/arminbiere/kissat) and ABC.

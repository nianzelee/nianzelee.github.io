## Short Biography

I am an [Assistant Professor](https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile1.php?teacher_id=27627)
at the Department of Electrical Engineering of National Taiwan University, Taiwan,
leading [Formal Methods and Analysis for Computing and Engineering Laboratory](https://formace-lab.gitlab.io/webpage/) (ForMACE Lab),
and a "Gastprofessor" (Visiting Professor) affiliated with [Software and Computational Systems Lab](https://www.sosy-lab.org/) (SoSy-Lab) at LMU Munich, Germany.
I obtained a Ph.D. degree in Electronics Engineering from National Taiwan University in 2021.
My research directions are the analysis and optimization of computing systems, with a focus on formal methods.

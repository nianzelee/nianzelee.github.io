**I am looking for Ph.D., Master's, and Bachelor's students to work on formal methods!**

- Information for prospective students
  - How to apply: [recruiting post](https://formace-lab.gitlab.io/webpage/posts/recruiting/)
  - My recent talk at the EDA seminar: [slides](../files/2025-02-24_EDA_Seminar_Nian-Ze.pdf)
- Ph.D. students may be enrolled at LMU Munich ([project](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/536040111?language=en) funded by DFG).

## Short Biography

I am an [Assistant Professor](https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile1.php?teacher_id=27627)
at the Department of Electrical Engineering of National Taiwan University, Taiwan,
leading [Formal Methods and Analysis for Computing and Engineering Laboratory](https://formace-lab.gitlab.io/webpage/) (ForMACE Lab),
and a "Gastprofessor" (Guest Professor) affiliated with [Software and Computational Systems Lab](https://www.sosy-lab.org/) (SoSy-Lab) at LMU Munich, Germany.
I obtained a Ph.D. degree in Electronics Engineering from National Taiwan University in 2021.
My research directions are the analysis and optimization of computing systems, with a focus on formal methods.
